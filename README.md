# project_2_deep_learning
This project accompanies the lecture deep learning (392221; Module 39-M-Inf-DL) and handels the MNIST dataset. Train a network using standard technology and investigate the behavior if the network is trained with adversial training instead of standard one. In how far is the possibility to attack the model reduced?
